In this portfolio project you will be applying the different skills you’ve acquired in the Machine Learning/AI foundations skill path to prepare a dataset for implementing machine learning modeling.

For this project, you will conduct your own analysis in a Jupyter Notebook and share your results through your personal GitHub page. This project can be included as part of your portfolio when you apply for data scientist and machine learning engineer jobs. It’s good practice to showcase a variety of skills in order to make your application shine.

Project Objectives
- Complete a project to add to your portfolio
- Use Git version control
- Use Jupyter notebooks to prepare a dataset for ML modeling

Prerequisites
ML/AI Foundations Skill Path

Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements. You should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.
